**Fare Summary**
To put it plainly, this summary tells a clear and obvious story on first glance - with more drivers and more rides, urban drivers overall rake in the most money, followed by suburban drivers, and further below them, rural drivers.

Overall, the trend lines run in fairly similar patterns, with some interesting nuances.

  * Urban
    * Urban drivers see several spikes  
  * Suburban
    * 
  * Rural
    * With an acknowledgement of bias, I see a concerning trend in mid-March. Urban and suburban fare totals spiked during this time, but not rural fare totals.
